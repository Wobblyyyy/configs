# configs
I've found that it's really, really, really annoying to have to figure out configuration files or settings for
an IDE or a game or anything, really, over and over again. So, to fix this issue, what better solution is there
than creating a Git repo that contains all the configuration files in one place?

This repo doesn't serve a purpose other than hosting my personal configuration files. That's it. That's all.

## Folder naming convention
Each directory has a prefix, an underscore, and then the name of the directory. The name of the directory should
describe the contents of the directory. Prefixes are as follows:
- "dev_": denotes configurations for something development-related
- "game_": denotes configurations for a video game
