# IDEA settings
Settings that I set on fresh installations.

## Font
Fonts are listed in order of preference. These fonts apply to the code editor, not the system font - I don't really
care what system font is used, I just don't want to get eye pain from my IDE.
1. "JetBrains Mono" - 13pt size, 1.25 line height
2. "Inconsolata" - 13pt size, 1.2 line height
3. "Fira Code" - 14pt size, 1.1 line height
